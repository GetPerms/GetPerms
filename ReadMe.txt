OFFICIAL RELEASE 2/16/12!

About: GetPerms is a plugin for Minecraft servers running Bukkit. This plugin will gather a list of all permission nodes for every plugin installed on the server and output the nodes to a file.

Installation:
  1. Download the plugin (you should have already)
  2. Move the jar file to '/plugins' inside the server root directory

Usage:
  1. Start the server
  2. Go into the server root directory
  3. Open 'pnodes.txt'

pnodes.txt:
  Each line is one separate permission node. Plugins must be in the '/plugins' folder and have permission nodes in '[plugin].jar/plugin.yml' in order for GetPerms to get the permission nodes from the plugin. Permission nodes are listed by plugins, which are in alphabetical order. A permission node's description is available in 'pnodesfull.txt' which is also in the server root directory. Useful if you want one to just copy and paste the nodes without having to highlight each line separately to avoid copying the description.

pnodesfull.txt
  Quite the same as pnodes.txt, except this one has the description next to each node.
