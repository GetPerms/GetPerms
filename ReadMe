About: GetPerms is a plugin for Minecraft servers running Bukkit. This plugin will gather a list of all permission nodes for every plugin installed on the server and output the nodes to a file.

Installation:
  1. Download the plugin (you should have already)
  2. Move the jar file to '/plugins' inside the server folder

Usage:
  1. Start the server
  2. Go into '/plugins/GetPerms/'
  3. Open 'pnodes.txt'

pnodes.txt:
  Each line is one separate permission node. Plugins must be in the '/plugins' folder in order for GetPerms to get the permission nodes from the plugin. Permission nodes are listed by plugins, which are in alphabetical order. A permission node's description is available in 'pnodesfull.txt' which is also in '/plugins/GetPerms'.
